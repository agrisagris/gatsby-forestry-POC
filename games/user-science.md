User **Science**

Why would we approach the building of an enterprise with science?

Science is exceptional at delivering outcomes through testing. By applying the scientific method we can structure our work to move towards an unbiased solution that delivers outcomes.

When we are looking to improve the marketing of a product there are a few ways to do it. In contrast, design thinking comes from an Apple approach which is very unscientific. Designers sit back and imagine what is possible, they dream up something that will amaze the world and the user and build it. This works for Apple, some of the time.

The other alternative is more conservative and comes from a humble place of curiosity and wonder. User Science is about saying, “I have a series of hypothesis that I have deduced from the study and now I shall run experiments to design the solution.”

Even before the hypothesis there is a method to the understanding of the problem that is scientific. The user scientist collects a variety of data and interviews to understand the user from many angles.
